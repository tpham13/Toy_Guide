        "title": "Watercolor Wooden Rainbow Puzzle",
        "description": "Encourage open ended, creative and imaginative play with this hand crafted, watercolor, wooden, rainbow puzzle. \n\nWhen put together, this puzzle is approximately 8&quot;x8&quot;. Pieces can be stacked, balanced and played with in many ways. The only limit is your imagination! \n\nEach puzzle is hand cut from pine wood. It is also sanded and painted by hand and will vary. The natural knots and wood grain vary. Each one is different and will not match exactly to this photo. \n\nAll wooden pieces are painted with non toxic paint and sealed with non toxic sealant so they are safe for little hands. Due to the nature of these toys, they are recommended for children 3 and above or for children who no longer put everything in their mouths. \n\n‚ú®Toys can be cleaned with a damp cloth but should never be submerged in water\n‚ú®Actual colors may vary slightly from the pictures \n‚ú®Each item is made with love and is carefully inspected by adults and tested by our 2 1/2 year old toddler. \n\nFor more information about open ended play and the many, many benefits, visit https://kellycarterteaches.com/boundlessplay/",

        "description": "Here are three vintage Fisher Price toys bundled together to save on shipping. Please see photos for description of condition. So many people remember the infamous FP toys. The bobbing musical bright red apple sounds like new. The pull toy bear with the popping balls also works well. The iconic FP telephone with the rolling eyes and rotary dial with the ringing sounds still has hours of fun left but soon kids won‚Äôt know what it is! See the photos for the graphics on the telephone. They are pretty good except for some damage on the back. The pull string is very frayed but e easily replaced.",
